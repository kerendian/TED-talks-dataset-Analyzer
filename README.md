## Conclusions
There are a few important features that affect views substantially. 

TED could use these findings to optimize their selection of speakers. They are as follows:

# Features that yield a positive effect

**Religion Tag:** Controversy between religion and atheism and its implementation in schooling

**Scientific views Tag:** Introduce lay people to scientific advancements

**Vices Tag:** People like to watch others go out on a limb and take a stand

**Event Type:** Scale of audience

# Features that yield a negative effect

**Music:** People don’t want TED to become the radio

**Middle East, Global Issues, Epidemics:** TED is seen as a positive idea platform and not necessarily a place for a news site

**TEDx:** Local topics generate conversation not views

**Arts/Creativity:** This is thought provoking but doesn’t necessarily spark conversation
